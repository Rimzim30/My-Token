# My-Token
The project was made by Ethereum-1 course. 
The state variable was used , which was public in nature. 
The mapping of function was also done.
The two functions were used named- Mint function and Burn function.
The Mint function uses the increasing value in the code ,whereas Burn function uses the opposite value i.e. the subtraction value .
As the code was deployed , the total supply was given as the subtraction of the burn value from the mint value.
